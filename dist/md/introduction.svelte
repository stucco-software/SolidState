<p>A graph-based realtime replication engine for creating offline first multiplayer applications. SolidState can replicate data peer-to-peer, through a persitent triplestore, or on Solid PODs.</p>
<p>SolidState is local-first. It can be used entirely without replication between stores as local client storage.</p>
<mark>As of 2025.10.05 SolidState is local-only, currently under active development for both sync and Solid POD storage</mark>
